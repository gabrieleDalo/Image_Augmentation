# Image_Augmentation
A simple project to parallelize image augmentation and compare performance vs. sequential version

To run the code (present in the Laboratory-Assignment folder) you must first download the images to be augmented and the related metadata and insert them into the folder called "dataset". The images used for the tests were taken from the site https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samdazel/teledyne-flir-adas-thermal-dataset-v2, and specifically only those present in the folder images_thermal_train were used (just copy and paste these folder into the "dataset" folder in Laboratory-Assignment).

Additionally, the All_results.txt file contains a complete version of the results obtained for a performance comparison test between the sequential version of the code and the different parallel versions tested.
